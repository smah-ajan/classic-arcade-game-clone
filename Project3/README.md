This project is about a 'Frogger' game. This game is named !!FROGGER!!. In this game there is a 'Player' named 'char-boy' who is going to 'win' the game by reaching the water again and again . Every time he reaches the water site  his 'chance' of making another attempt get plussed by '1'. In this attempts he faces some difficulties like to save himself from colliding with the 'Enemies' which are 4 in numbers and are running at random speed. If he gets collided with any 'enemy' then he has to start again and with penality of minus '1' 'chance'. By default  'chance' starts with '2' . And when 'chance' reaches '0' then 'Game is Over'. To make it more interesting one more element is added and it is called 'Life'. 'Life' is 'Heart' which 'char-boy' has to collect in his way to reach water site. One 'Life' he collects the 'score' shows '100' points. And it gets plussed by '100'  with every collection.
